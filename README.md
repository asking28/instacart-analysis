## Exploratory Data Analysis of Instacart Market Data
Instacart provided their anonymized order details of 3 million orders. Data contains information about a number of items in particular order id and item name in sequence, time of the day during which order was placed, the day of the week, aisle type, department and number of reorders. Data analysis is done using Python libraries pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Numpy. The relation of reordered items with other features is explored.<br/>

Data contains information of 206,209 customers and this data is divided into 131,209 customers in training and 75,000 customers in test data. Data contains information about 4 to 100 orders of each customer. So there are no customers with orders less than 4 and maximum limit is capped at 100. There are maximum customers with 4 orders and then the number of customer decreses with increasing number of orders.![](https://github.com/asking28/instacart_analysis/blob/master/fig2.png)<br/>
Customers shop more on Saturdays and Sundays than any other day of the week.
![](https://github.com/asking28/instacart_analysis/blob/master/fig3.png)<br/>It is an obvious trend that people prefer to shop more during weekends than on weekdays, so accordingly the shop should be stacked to meet the demands and keep the items fresh. The analysis shows that most of the customers prefer shopping between 9 am to 5 pm.![](https://github.com/asking28/instacart_analysis/blob/master/fig4.png)<br/>
These are the peak hours of shopping and the number of customers starts decreasing during night hours. Through heat map of an hour of the day, day of week and number of orders it can be inferred from the density that on Saturday and Sunday from 10 am to 4 am customers order the most.![](https://github.com/asking28/instacart_analysis/blob/master/fig5.png)<br/>
Through the bar plot shopping trend of customers is analyzed. There is a general trend of shopping weekly and monthly. Customers prefer shopping in the gap on 7 days or 30 days. This gives the cyclic trend of customers. There are smaller peaks on 14 and 21 days (weekly interval). Analysis of a number of products ordered together shows a peak at 5 and 6, and slightly lower from 1 to 12.
![](https://github.com/asking28/instacart_analysis/blob/master/fig6.png)<br/>So in conclusion customers prefer to buy 1 to 12 items together. The frequency of every item in the dataset is sorted in decreasing order, organic food is ordered the most and most of them are fruits. When we plot with respect to the type of aisle, fresh fruits and fresh vegetables are ordered the most.![](https://github.com/asking28/instacart_analysis/blob/master/fig8.png) <br/>This analysis is important because it helps in placing items frequently bought together with them should be recommended together and business can be planned accordingly.Bar plot show number of items in a particular order. It shows that there are around 6 to 12 items in an average in every order.
![](https://github.com/asking28/instacart_analysis/blob/master/fig7.png)<br/>Breakfast bakery and bread are most frequently reordered type of aisle. Products that are added initially to the basket have the highest probability of being reordered. ![](https://github.com/asking28/instacart_analysis/blob/master/fig12.png)<br/>This makes sense as we tend to add the products to our basket earlier that we order frequently. A product that is ordered between 5 am to 9 am has the highest probability of being reordered again.
![](https://github.com/asking28/instacart_analysis/blob/master/fig14.png)<br/>Products have an almost the same probability of being reordered in any day of the week.

This exploratory data analysis can help in business planning and customizing the recommendations for every customer<br/>
